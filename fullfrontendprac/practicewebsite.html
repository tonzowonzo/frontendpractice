The year is 2100. Scotland is a grim place ruled by rebels. Once glorious, the Sistine Chapel is now possessed.

Helpful shopkeeper, Prof Boris Clifford is humanity's only hope. Boris finds the courage to start a secret revolutionary organization called Z.

The fight is jeopardised when Boris is tricked by cowardly lawyer, Lady Dolly Chan, and injures his finger.

Armed with wit and space rockets, Z try their best to save mankind, but can they defeat brutal rebels and restore the Sistine Chapel to its former glory?
